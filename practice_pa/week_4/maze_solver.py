# Alice wants to find the key in a maze and get out of it. The maze representation is given below, where X represents walls, space represents the allowed tiles Alice can walk on and üóù represents the tile that has the key.

# There is only one tile opening in the left-most vertical wall, where Alice is initially standing.

# Similarly there is only one tile opening in the right-most vertical wall, from which Alice has to exit.

# Alice can travel horizontally or vertically, but cannot travel diagonally. Moving to adjacent tile vertically or horizontally is counted as a step.

# There are three possible outcomes, either you can exit the maze after getting the key, or the key is not reachable or the finish tile is not reachable.

# Print the minimum number of steps Alice requires to reach the finish tile traveling through tile having the key.

# If the key tile is not reachable then print -1.

# If the key tile is reachable but finish tile is not reachable then print -2.
