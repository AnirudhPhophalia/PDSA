# Write a Python function findCommonElements(L1, L2) that accepts two integer lists L1 and L2 of same length n and return a list that contains elements that are common to both lists. Write a efficient solution that runs in O(nlogn) or better time.

# L1 contains all distinct integers and L2 contains all distinct integers, but there can be many elements common between L1 and L2.
# Returned list contains all elements that are common to L1 and L2. The elements in the returned list can be in any order.
